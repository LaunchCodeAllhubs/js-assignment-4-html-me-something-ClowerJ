      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">My wife and I bought a house in late 2015 and moved in during the beginning
         of 2016. Well it wasnt more than a couple months of her checking pet finder everyday
         and sending me cute rescue dogs then immediately telling me that we needed a fence before we got a dog
         that she saw one she wanted to go meet.</p>

         <h1>April 2016 we met 'Jake' the australian shepherd</h1>
         <p>She saw a cute dog on pet finder at a nearby shelter and decided we needed to go meet him.
         He was somewhat apathetic to see us but was excited to got out in the play zone and chase some
         balls around.</p>
         
         <h1>'Jake' has a new home</h1>
         <p>We pretty much instantly knew he was going to be coming home with us. We had to wait
         for another family that was scheduled to come up and meet him however. Lucky for us they did
         not show up and we were called the next day to see if we still wanted to takr him home.</p>

         <img src = "images/Achilles Home.jpg" alt= "Achilles Home" width="500" height="333">
         <h1>Achilles was home</h1>
         <p>We went and picked him up and stopped by the store for fresh dog supplies as all we had was the collar
         he came with and a starter leash they had given to us as he was a runner. They informed us that he had
         run away from home a few times and the previous owner had just said to keep him the last time they called.
         True to form, while waiting in the car for my wife to bring some supplies out he chomped through his leash in moments.</p>

         <img src = "images/Furry Brother.jpg" alt = "Furry Brother" width="500" height="333">
         <h1>From single child to furry brother</h1>
         <p>In 2017 my wife and I decided to get our foster license, it wasn't long after finishing the training classes that
         we started to recieve calls for placement. By August we were placed with two brothers ages 1 and 5, suddenly Achilles
         had to share his time instead of always being the center of attention.</p>

         <img src = "images/Aussies are goofballs.jpg" alt = "Goofball" width="500" height="333">
         <h1>Fast forward to adoption 2020</h1>
         <p>Excited to have the boys become a permanent addition to our family, Achilles has adapted to sharing his time and plkaying with the boys.
         But with school, work and general life happening Achilles did not get his multiple walks per day, or his weekend agility class since commute 
         was too far. His discontent was becoming much more barking and deciding that his new job was to be a guardian since he was
         no longer an agility course dog.</p>

         <img src = "images/Achilles needs a friend.jpg" alt = "Needing a friend"  width="500" height="333">
         <h1>April 2021 Achilles needs a friend</h1>
         <p>Feeling bad at the lack of one on one time that Achilles was receiving we decided that he needed a friend to keep him busy during the day while
         we were at work. Back to pet finder and trying to find a similar minded puppy that he could bond with and expend some energy with so that he was
         not going stir crazy all the time.</p>

         <img src = "images/Odin is Home.jpg" alt = "Odin comes home" width="500" height="333">
         <h1>Strike one when meeting a 'blue heeler'</h1>
         <p>We went to St. Louis and met with a woman who was fostering a 'blue heeler' that seemed like a good fit. Upon meeting this dog we immediately realized
         that this was majority chihuaua and just the colors of a heeler. It chased the kids and tried to bite their feet and when Achilles would attempt to play with it
         he about got his eyes bit and scratched out.</p>

         <h7>Horton the rescue pup</h7>
         <p>We found a litter of puppies that were rescued from a bad situation and were all named after Dr. Seuss characters. The kids thought he was adorable, my wife thought he was 
         very chill, Achilles just wanted to run and play in the foster ladies yard, and I thought I was finally getting my big dog. Horton appeared to be a St. Bernard.</p>

         <img src = "images/Lover not a fighter.jpg" alt = "Big Heart" width="500" height="333">
         <h8>Odin comes home</h8>
         <p>After having to spend a few weeks with the foster to nurse his health up after being so malnurished we got to go pick up Odin and officially welcome him to the family.
         Still so sure he was a St. Bernard, I went ahead and ordered his barrel. DNA test results came back as being mostly great pyraneese and some german shepherd and beagle of all things.
         Topping out at about 70 lbs he is not the big dog I have always wanted, but he is big of heart and as sweet as he is scared of all new people around him.</p>
